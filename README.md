# About this project

Ther are soo many tools or websites that allows to share files over the internet with people,
however I didn't find one simpler and intuitive to use, not filled with ads or pricing plans ...
So I thought, why not build one myself, a one that suits my style and linking - I think this is it :smiely:

or being accessed by someone else other the people I want to share it with.
